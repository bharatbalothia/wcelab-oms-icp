# OMS ICP deployment and configuration

**[NZ May2] Is there a way to automate or script this? Maybe it is not worth the effort since we can just execute three scripts in ICP Web UI's "Create Resource" dialog box?**

**[HM May2] We can have all three merged into a helm chart or a single yaml file and use Jenkins to automate this process of deployment using kubectl congifuration . We have already integrated this in RSC**
